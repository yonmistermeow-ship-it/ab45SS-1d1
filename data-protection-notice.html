          To safeguard your personal data from unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks, we have implemented appropriate administrative, physical, and technical measures. These include up-to-date antivirus protection, encryption, and the use of privacy filters to secure all storage and transmission of personal data. Personal data is disclosed both internally and to our authorised third-party service providers and agents only on a need-to-know basis.
